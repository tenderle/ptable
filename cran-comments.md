## Re-Submission

I have fixed all review issues after the first submission: 

* replace `\dontrun` with `\donttest`
* remove examples
* use `on.exit()` 
* use or adjust return `values`
* use `interactive()`
* replace `cat()` with `message()`
* adjust DESCRIPTION file

## R CMD check results

Checked this package `ptable 1.0.0` with win-builder (R-release and R-devel) 
with no errors and no warnings.

There is only one note regarding my first submission of the package and a
reference to an author that is correct:

> New submission
> 
> Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION
>   Giessing (16:50)


Thanks for the review and putting this new package to CRAN,
Tobias
