Description: Tabular data from statistical institutes and agencies are mostly 
    confidential and must be protected prior to publications. The cell-key 
    method is a post-tabular Statistical Disclosure Control perturbation 
    technique that adds random noise to tabular data. The statistical 
    properties of the perturbations are defined by some noise probability 
    distributions - also referred to as perturbation tables. 
    This tool can be used to create the perturbation tables based on a maximum 
    entropy approach as described for example in Giessing (2016) 
    <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-45381-1_18>. The perturbation tables created can 
    finally be used to apply a cell-key method to frequency count or magnitude 
    tables.
